# Epic 2: Adaptive Scoring System User Stories

## Overview
Implement intelligent scoring that adjusts weights and priorities based on API profile and business context, replacing the rigid one-size-fits-all scoring model.

## Story 2.1: Dynamic Weight Calculation
**As a** developer  
**I want** scoring weights to adjust based on my API type  
**So that** I receive relevant grades for my specific use case

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Base weights are modified by profile multipliers
2. Weight adjustments are transparent and explainable
3. Total weights always normalize to 100%
4. Critical rules maintain minimum weight thresholds
5. Weight calculations complete in < 100ms

### Technical Context for API Contract
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/scoring/calculate-weights`
- **Request**: Profile ID, rule set, context parameters
- **Response**: Adjusted weights with calculation breakdown
- **Algorithm**: Configurable weight distribution strategy

### Edge Cases
- Zero weights for critical security rules (enforce minimums)
- Weight overflow when multipliers stack
- Conflicting weight adjustments from multiple sources
- Performance with 100+ rules
- Weights for newly added rules without profile config

## Story 2.2: Priority-Based Rule Evaluation
**As a** developer  
**I want** rules evaluated in priority order  
**So that** critical issues are highlighted even if overall score is good

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Rules grouped into priority tiers (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
2. Critical failures override high aggregate scores
3. Priority affects both scoring and report ordering
4. User can see score breakdown by priority
5. Priority thresholds are configurable per profile

### Technical Context for API Contract
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/scoring/evaluate`
- **Request**: Grading results with rule violations
- **Response**: Prioritized score with tier breakdowns
- **Display**: Critical issues shown prominently regardless of score

### Edge Cases
- All rules marked as critical (system enforces distribution)
- No critical issues but low overall score
- Priority conflicts between profile and global settings
- Dynamic priority based on context (e.g., production vs development)
- Priority inheritance in rule hierarchies

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Context factors affect final score:
   - API maturity (beta, stable, deprecated)
   - Audience (internal, partner, public)
   - Criticality (mission-critical, standard, experimental)
2. Adjustments are capped at Â±20% of base score
3. Context reasoning appears in grade report
4. Multiple contexts can be applied simultaneously
5. Context effects are reversible

### Technical Context for API Contract
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/scoring/apply-context`
- **Request**: Base score, context parameters
- **Response**: Adjusted score with context impact analysis
- **Persistence**: Context stored with grading session

### Edge Cases
- Conflicting context parameters
- Context pushing score beyond 0-100 range
- Missing context for critical APIs
- Context changes after grading
- Regulatory contexts overriding adjustments

- **Privacy**: Anonymized data aggregation

### Edge Cases
- Insufficient benchmark data for comparison
- Outlier scores skewing benchmarks
- Privacy concerns with benchmark data
- Gaming the system for better rankings
- Benchmark relevance for unique APIs
