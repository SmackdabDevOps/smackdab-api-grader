## Development Prioritization

### Phase 1: Foundation (Must Have)
1. **Profile System** (Epic 1, Stories 1.1-1.4)
2. **Basic Adaptive Scoring** (Epic 2, Stories 2.1-2.3)
3. **Legacy Mode Toggle** (Epic 6, Story 6.1)

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Should Have)
1. **Pattern Detection** (Epic 3, Stories 3.1-3.2)
2. **Business Domain Extraction** (Epic 4, Stories 4.1-4.2)
3. **Admin Dashboard** (Epic 6, Story 6.4)

### Phase 3: Learning (Could Have)
1. **Feedback Collection** (Epic 5, Stories 5.1-5.3)
2. **Pattern Learning** (Epic 5, Stories 5.4-5.5)
3. **A/B Testing** (Epic 5, Story 5.11)

### Phase 4: Scale (Won't Have - Future)
1. **ML Detection** (Epic 3, Stories 3.2, 3.10)
2. **Cross-Platform** (Epic 7, Story 7.12)
3. **Extreme Scale** (Epic 7, Story 7.11)

## API Contract Development Guidelines

### For Each User Story
1. **Review acceptance criteria** for functional requirements
2. **Check technical context** for API design guidance
3. **Consider edge cases** for error handling
4. **Reference dependencies** for integration points

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful conventions** for resource endpoints
- **Consistent error formats** across all endpoints
- **Versioning strategy** from day one
- **Authentication/authorization** on all admin endpoints
- **Rate limiting** for all public endpoints
- **Audit logging** for all state changes

### Response Standards
```json
{
  "success": true|false,
  "data": {...},
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": {...}
  },
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Story Point Estimation

### Complexity Factors
- **Small (1-3 points)**: Single endpoint, simple logic, no dependencies
- **Medium (5-8 points)**: Multiple endpoints, moderate logic, some dependencies
- **Large (13-21 points)**: Complex logic, ML/AI components, multiple integrations

### Epic Estimates
- Epic 1: ~55 points
- Epic 2: ~65 points
- Epic 3: ~85 points
- Epic 4: ~75 points
- Epic 5: ~95 points
- Epic 6: ~80 points
- Epic 7: ~70 points
- **Total**: ~525 story points

## Success Metrics

   - Mitigation: Training, documentation
2. **Technical debt** accumulation
   - Mitigation: Refactoring sprints
3. **Third-party** service dependencies
   - Mitigation: Fallback mechanisms

## Team Allocation Recommendations

### Suggested Team Structure
- **Core Platform Team** (4 engineers): Epics 1, 2, 6
- **ML/Detection Team** (3 engineers): Epic 3
- **Business Logic Team** (3 engineers): Epic 4
- **Feedback Team** (2 engineers): Epic 5
- **Infrastructure Team** (2 engineers): Epic 7
- **QA Team** (2 engineers): Cross-epic testing
- **Product Owner** (1): Prioritization and acceptance
- **Technical Lead** (1): Architecture and integration

## Next Steps

1. **API Contract Creation**: Start with Epic 1, Stories 1.1-1.3
2. **Database Schema Design**: Profile and configuration storage
3. **Prototype Development**: MVP with basic profile support
4. **Testing Framework**: Set up integration test infrastructure
5. **Documentation**: API documentation and developer guides
