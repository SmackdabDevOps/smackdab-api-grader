## Data Flow

### Input Processing
1. **API Specification** enters the system
2. **Enhanced Detection Engine** analyzes the spec using:
   - ML feature extraction (40+ features)
   - Pattern matching libraries
   - Consensus building between methods

### Context Extraction
1. **Business Analyzer** extracts:
   - Business domain (15 domains)
   - Data classification
   - Geographic scope
2. **Domain Detector** identifies:
   - Industry-specific patterns
   - Vertical requirements
3. **Requirement Mapper** determines:
   - Compliance requirements
   - Mandatory rules
   - Industry standards

### Profile Application
1. **Detection Engine** determines API type
2. **Profile Manager** selects appropriate profile:
   - REST (no multi-tenant required)
   - GraphQL (query/mutation specific)
   - gRPC (streaming patterns)
   - SaaS (multi-tenant required)
   - Microservice (bounded context)

### Adaptive Scoring
1. **Adaptive Scoring Engine** calculates weights based on:
   - API type profile
   - Business domain
   - Compliance requirements
2. **Priority Calculator** adjusts rule priorities:
   - Critical for finance/healthcare
   - Standard for general APIs
   - Domain-specific adjustments

### Learning Integration
1. **Feedback UI** presents forms to users
2. **Feedback Collector** aggregates responses
3. **Learning Engine** trains on feedback:
   - Gradient descent optimization
   - Regularization to prevent overfitting
   - Confidence-based adjustments
4. **Learning Pipeline** orchestrates the process

### Safe Deployment
1. **Feature Flags** control feature availability
2. **Migration Controller** manages rollout:
   - Canary deployment (5%)
   - Gradual rollout (8 weeks)
   - Continuous monitoring
3. **Rollback Manager** handles failures:
   - Emergency rollback (<1 minute)
   - Partial rollback (5 minutes)
   - Full rollback (10 minutes)

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Consensus Pattern
Multiple detection methods vote on API type:
```typescript
const mlConfidence = mlDetector.detect(spec);
const patternConfidence = patternMatcher.detect(spec);
const consensus = buildConsensus(mlConfidence, patternConfidence);
```

### 2. Fallback Pattern
Low confidence triggers safe defaults:
```typescript
if (confidence < 0.5) {
  return { type: 'REST', reason: 'Low confidence fallback' };
}
```

### 3. Strategy Pattern
Different profiles for different API types:
```typescript
const profile = profileManager.getProfile(detectedType);
const rules = profile.getRules();
```

### 4. Observer Pattern
Feedback collection observes grading results:
```typescript
gradingPipeline.on('complete', (result) => {
  feedbackCollector.requestFeedback(result);
});
```

### 5. Circuit Breaker Pattern
Automatic rollback on critical metrics:
```typescript
if (errorRate > threshold) {
  rollbackManager.executeEmergencyRollback();
}
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- Database query optimization
- Memory-efficient feature extraction

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- No PII in feedback collection
- Encrypted model storage
- Secure API spec handling
- Audit trail for changes

### Compliance Coverage
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare APIs
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment processing
- **GDPR**: European data protection
- **SOX**: Financial reporting
- **FERPA**: Education records
- **FedRAMP**: Government systems
- **ISO-27001**: Information security
- **CCPA**: California privacy

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
```yaml

  - accuracy_rate
  - confidence_distribution
  - api_type_breakdown
  
Scoring:
  - average_score

## Conclusion

The Phase 2 architecture transforms the API Grader into a sophisticated, self-improving system that:

1. **Intelligently detects** API types and contexts
2. **Adaptively grades** based on appropriate rules
3. **Continuously learns** from user feedback
4. **Safely deploys** with comprehensive controls

This architecture provides the foundation for accurate, context-aware API grading that adapts to diverse API ecosystems while maintaining high performance and reliability.
